            <p>I had to make a review of multiple browsers for this assignment. a lot of the information is half-assed since the assignment is more about the design than the content so I wouldn't use it as an actual recommendation</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">The website can be seen <a href="assignments/browser.html" target="_blank">here</a></p>
            <p>I took a lot of the comparison stuff from the Firefox website and the color scheme came from Coolors to save me time. Otherwise I think the website looks nice, just a bit on the corporate side. I wanted to add like fade in animations to the text to make it feel more alive but I felt like that would be a bit too much effort for the first assignment in this class.</p>
