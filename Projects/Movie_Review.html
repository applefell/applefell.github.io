            <p>I had to make a review of a movie for this assignment, I barely paid attention to the movie while doin other stuff so idk if some of the info in there is actually right lol.</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">The website can be seen <a href="assignments/movie.html" target="_blank">here</a></p>
            <p>I wouldn't say the movie was a bad one I just wasn't super interested in it and kinda wanted to get other stuff done instead.</p>
            <p>I don't like how this site looks as much as the browser review but I just wanted to get it done fast so I think it's good enough. Once again used a color scheme from Coolors cuz making original color schemes is hard.</p>
